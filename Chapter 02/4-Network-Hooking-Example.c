//A kernel-mode driver can be used to hook into network-related functions such as NtDeviceIoControlFile, which is used for various network operations. Here’s a simplified example in C:

#include <ntddk.h>

NTSTATUS DriverEntry(
    _In_ PDRIVER_OBJECT DriverObject,
    _In_ PUNICODE_STRING RegistryPath
);

VOID UnloadDriver(
    _In_ PDRIVER_OBJECT DriverObject
);

NTSTATUS NetworkIoControlCallback(
    _In_ PDEVICE_OBJECT DeviceObject,
    _In_ PIRP Irp
);

NTSTATUS DriverEntry(
    _In_ PDRIVER_OBJECT DriverObject,
    _In_ PUNICODE_STRING RegistryPath
)
{
    UNREFERENCED_PARAMETER(RegistryPath);

    DriverObject->DriverUnload = UnloadDriver;

    // Hook into network-related functions
    DriverObject->MajorFunction[IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL] = NetworkIoControlCallback;

    DbgPrint("Network monitoring driver loaded\n");

    return STATUS_SUCCESS;
}

VOID UnloadDriver(
    _In_ PDRIVER_OBJECT DriverObject
)
{
    UNREFERENCED_PARAMETER(DriverObject);
    DbgPrint("Network monitoring driver unloaded\n");
}

NTSTATUS NetworkIoControlCallback(
    _In_ PDEVICE_OBJECT DeviceObject,
    _In_ PIRP Irp
)
{
    PIO_STACK_LOCATION stack = IoGetCurrentIrpStackLocation(Irp);

    if (stack->Parameters.DeviceIoControl.IoControlCode == IOCTL_TCP_QUERY_INFORMATION_EX) {
        DbgPrint("Network connection detected\n");
        // Log network connection details here
    }

    // Pass the IRP down the driver stack
    IoSkipCurrentIrpStackLocation(Irp);
    return IoCallDriver(DeviceObject, Irp);
}

/*Explanation
Driver Entry and Unload:
  -	The DriverEntry function initializes the driver and sets up the callback function for network-related operations. The UnloadDriver function is called when the driver is unloaded.
  
Hooking Network Functions:
  -	The DriverObject->MajorFunction[IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL] is used to hook into device control operations, which include network-related functions. The NetworkIoControlCallback function is registered to handle these operations.
  
Callback Function:
  -	The NetworkIoControlCallback function is called whenever a device control operation occurs. It checks if the operation is related to network connections (e.g., IOCTL_TCP_QUERY_INFORMATION_EX) and logs the network connection details.
  -	The callback function then passes the IRP (I/O Request Packet) down the driver stack to ensure normal operation.
By using these hooks, an EDR solution can monitor and log network activities, providing visibility into network connections and communications. This information is crucial for detecting and responding to network-based threats in real-time.
